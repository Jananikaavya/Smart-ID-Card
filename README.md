# Smart ID Card — Minimal Vite + React Scaffold

This repository contains a minimal Vite + React (JavaScript) scaffold. It intentionally includes only the basic files needed to start development.

Quick start (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 3. Build for production
npm run build

# 4. Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

Key files:

- `package.json` — scripts and deps
- `index.html` — app entry
- `src/main.jsx` — React entry
- `src/App.jsx` — minimal app component
- `src/index.css` — basic styles

If you want, I can now:
- install dependencies and start the dev server locally (takes longer), or
- add a small example component structure (components/pages) — let me know which.
